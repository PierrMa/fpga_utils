This repository contains basics componant for FPGA. 
In sources_1 you will find HDL designs in VHDL or SystemVerilog.
In sim_1 you will find the code that allow to simulate the above designs in VHDL or SystemVerilog.
Here are the components found in this repository:
- half adder
- full adder
- mux (2 to 1, 8 to 1 and N to 1)
- demux (1 to 2 and 1 to 4)
- carry look ahead adder
- ripple adder
- Booth multiplier
- flip flops (D and SR)
- universal shift register
- linear feedback shift register (LFSR)
- converter (gray code to binary, binary to gray code)
- synchronous FIFO
- asynchronous FIFO
